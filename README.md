Hello, I am releasing this gamemode because I need to free up a little time to work on something new. That does not mean I am done working on it. I am taking a little break for now, feel free to make a PR for new features.

**Current features:**
* Unlock and buy cars with drift points/money.
* Modify cars with drift points/money.
* unlock maps or pay to teleport to them.
* Hitting stuff while drifting will make you lose your current drift combo.
* Currently there is 6 ranks, 5 of which you can unlock with drift points/money.
* Increasing your rank will allow you to buy more cars and teleport to maps without paying.
* Drift points, vehicles and mods are saved through mysql.
* + More just cant think about them all.

**Unfinished features:**
* Noclip with a timer to stop people from going to other maps. (almost done just needs to grab the vehicle if the player is driving.)
* Scoreboard ( needs to display correct values)


**Upcoming features:**
* Group race to x value of points
* Saving of highest drift combos for each map. 
* Announcing when a high score for a map was broken.
* Proper User system

**Requirements:**
* Mysql-Async

**Credits:**
* Creator of fcustoms (was converted to use my currency and added mysql support)
* Creator of the Drift counter (Used for the base currency and added object collision + hud)
